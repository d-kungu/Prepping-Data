[**Week 21**](https://preppindata.blogspot.com/2022/05/2022-week-21-multi-sheets-of-madness.html)

USE CASE: Reading unstructured excel file

Requirements:
- Bring together the Key Metrics tables from each Shop - different sheets
- Filter fields that report the quarter and retain monthly values. 
- Reshape the data so that we have a Date field.
- For Orders and Returns, we are only interested in reporting % values, whilst for Complaints we are only interested in the # Received
- Update the Breakdown field to include the Department to make the Measure Name easier to interpret
- Pivot each measure to create a field for each of the measures rather than a row per measure
- Pivot the targets metrices for each measure as field that we can compare each measure to actual values.
